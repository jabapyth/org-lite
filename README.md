# Org Lite

Org Lite will parse org files, giving you access to the parts that I care
about ;) this may well be expanded into a full-featured parser/serializer, but
for the moment, these are the things that are handled:

- Headings
- tags on headings
- the PROPERTIES drawer

Things I will likely care about in the near future:

- timestamps
- clock in/out
- duration

Things I will likely continue to ignore:

- anything content-wise; lists, tables, etc.
